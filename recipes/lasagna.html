    <h1>LASAGNA</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div><p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is beloved around the world.
        It consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets (lasagna noodles) interspersed
        with rich and savory fillings, typically a hearty meat sauce (ragù),
        creamy béchamel sauce, and various cheeses like mozzarella and Parmesan.
        The dish is baked until golden, bubbly, and tender, resulting in a comforting
        and satisfying meal. The combination of textures and flavors—the soft pasta,
        the rich sauce, the gooey cheese, and the crispy edges—makes it a quintessential
        comfort food.</p></div>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong><li class="li">Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C)</li></strong>
        <strong><li class="li">Prepare the Meat Sauce:</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.<br> 
                    Add the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent <br>
                    (about 5-7 minutes)</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Increase heat to medium-high. Add the ground beef and Italian sausage.<br> 
                    Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until browned and <br>
                    cooked through. Drain excess grease if necessary.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, <br>
                    and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and <br>
                    let simmer for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld</li>
            </ul>
        <strong><li class="li">Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>While the meat sauce simmers, in a separate medium saucepan,<br> 
                    melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for <br>
                    about 1 minute, stirring constantly.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in the milk until the mixture is smooth. Continue <br>
                    cooking over medium heat, whisking frequently, until the sauce thickens <br>
                    enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 5-8 minutes).</li>
                <li>Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper, then remove from heat.</li>
            </ul>

        <strong><li class="li">Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, beaten egg, 1/4 cup <br>
                    Parmesan cheese, parsley (if using), and salt. Mix well until smooth</ul>
            </ul>
        <strong><li class="li">Assemble the Lasagna:</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: If using regular noodles (not oven-ready), boil them according <br>
                    to package directions and drain well before assembly.</li>
                <li>Spread about 1/2 cup of the meat sauce across the bottom of a <br>
                    9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Top with about 1/4 of the remaining meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Drizzle about 1/3 of the béchamel sauce over the meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers once more: noodles, remaining ricotta mixture,<br> 
                    1/4 of the meat sauce, 1/3 of the béchamel, and mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Add a final layer of noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and <br>
                    the last of the béchamel sauce.</li>
                <li>Top everything with the remaining mozzarella and the remaining 1/2 <br>
                    cup of Parmesan cheese</li> 
            </ul> 
        <strong><li class="li">Bake:</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil (tent slightly so <br>
                    it doesn't touch the cheese).</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until<br> 
                    the top is golden brown and bubbly</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing<br> 
                    and serving. This helps it set and makes serving cleaner.</li>
            </ul>
